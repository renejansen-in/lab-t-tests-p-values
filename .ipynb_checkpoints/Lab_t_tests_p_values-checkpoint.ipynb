    "1. One tailed t-test - In a packing plant, a machine packs cartons with jars. It is supposed that a new machine will pack faster on the average than the machine currently used. To test that hypothesis, the times it takes each machine to pack ten cartons are recorded. The results, in seconds, are shown in the tables in the file files_for_lab/machine.txt. Assume that there is sufficient evidence to conduct the t test, does the data provide sufficient evidence to show if one machine is better than the other? ",
    "\n",
    "2. Matched Pairs Test - In this challenge we will compare dependent samples of data describing our Pokemon (file files_for_lab/pokemon.csv). Our goal is to see whether there is a significant difference between each Pokemon's defense and attack scores. Our hypothesis is that the defense and attack scores are equal. Compare the two columns to see if there is a statistically significant difference between them and comment your result. ",

    "Suppose you are working as an analyst in a microprocessor chip manufacturing plant. You have been given the task of analyzing a plasma etching process with respect to changing Power (in Watts) of the plasma beam. Data was collected and provided to you to conduct statistical analysis and check if changing the power of the plasma beam has any effect on the etching rate by the machine. You will conduct ANOVA and check if there is any difference in the mean etching rate for different levels of power. You can find the data anova_lab_data.xlsx file in the files_for_lab folder\n",
